# Paracore Starter Scripts

Paracore is a developer-first automation platform for Autodesk Revit.  
These starter scripts demonstrate how to automate Revit using raw C# Revit API code.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (TL;DR)

1. Install **RServer.Addin.exe** → Open Revit → Toggle **RServer ON** in the Paracore tab.  
2. Install **Paracore_Installer.msi** → Launch Paracore (auto-connects to Revit).  
3. Clone this repo → Add the folder in Paracore’s **Local Folders** sidebar.  
4. Open an empty Revit project → Run scripts from the gallery.  
5. Experiment safely before applying to real projects.

## 📥 Installation

Before using the scripts, you need to install Paracore and its Revit add-in.  
All installers are available on the [Releases page](../../releases).

1. **Download from Releases**  
   - Paracore_Installer.msi (v1.0.0)  
   - RServer.Addin.exe (v1.0.0)  
   - (Optional) corescript-0.0.1.vsix VSCode extension  
     → For developers who want to execute code directly from VSCode to Revit.  
     → Paracore itself does not require this extension.

2. **Install the Revit Add-in**  
   - Run `RServer.Addin.exe`.  
   - Open Revit.  
   - In the **Paracore tab**, toggle **RServer ON**.

3. **Install the Paracore App**  
   - Run `Paracore_Installer.msi`.  
   - At the end of installation, check **Start Paracore**.  
   - Paracore will launch and immediately connect to the active Revit session (make sure a document is open).

## 📂 Adding Scripts to Paracore

1. In the Paracore UI, click the **hamburger menu** (top left).  
2. Open the **Sidebar**.  
3. In the **Local Folders** section, click the **+ button** (Add Folder).  
4. In the file explorer dialog, select the `Paracore-Scripts` folder you cloned from GitHub.  
5. The scripts will now appear in the **Script Gallery**.

## 🧪 First Steps

- Open an **empty Revit project** before experimenting with scripts.  
- This ensures you can safely test automation without affecting a real project.  
- Once comfortable, apply scripts to production projects.

## 📜 Scripts Included

All scripts appear as ScriptCards in the Paracore gallery.

### 🔹 Single-file scripts
- **Create_Wall.cs** → Build a wall with parameters for level, length, and height.  
- **DeleteAllWalls.cs** → Remove all walls in the current project.  
- **ListWallTypes.cs / ListWallSweepTypes.cs / ListWallSweepProfiles.cs** → Enumerate wall types and profiles.  
- **SelectAndZoom.cs** → Select elements and zoom the view.  
- **Wall_Geometry_Editor.cs** → Edit wall geometry interactively.

### 🔹 Multi-file scripts (modularized)
- **Create_Walls/** → Multi-file script for modular wall creation.  
- **Create_Spiral_Wall/** → Multi-file script for spiral wall generation.  

👉 Multi-file scripts are treated as single ScriptCards. The engine automatically resolves references, so you can run them just like single-file scripts.

### 🔹 Generated scripts
- **GeneratedScriptOne.cs / GeneratedScriptTwo.cs** → Complex scripts generated by Paracore.
